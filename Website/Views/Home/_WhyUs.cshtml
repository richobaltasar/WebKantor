                        Internet of things is a concept or program where an object has the ability to transmit or transmit
                        data over a network without using the help of computer and human devices. The internet of things
                        or often referred to as IoT is currently experiencing many developments.

                                Simplify the connectivity process

                                    The first benefit of IoT is that it makes it easier to connect between devices or machines. The
                                    better the connection between the networks, the device system can run faster and more flexibly.
                                    You may still use conventional tools, but if you are trying to operate a system centrally only
                                    through mobile devices, then the answer is definitely using smart technology.

                                    The second benefit of the internet of things is the achievement of work efficiency. The more
                                    network connectivity that builds up, the less the amount of time it takes to perform a task will
                                    decrease. Thus, human activity and performance will be more assisted by the existence of IoT.

                                    By using the internet of things, the effectiveness of controlling and monitoring a job becomes
                                    easier. In addition, intelligent technology is also able to provide recommendations or work alternatives that are easier for users.
